    <h2>"The toppings contain potassium benzoate... That’s bad."</h2>

    <p>If you can't buy a toy, at least buy a forbidden object from places men fear to tread.  Or a frozen yogurt, aka frogurt.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Greek Yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine yogurt with honey and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine and freeze for at least one hour.</li>
        <li>After removing from the freezer, whisk again to remove any ice crystals and serve with your choice of toppings.</li>
        <li>Draw a pentagram on your floor and invoke a chant to Satan, asking that a curse be placed on the yogurt.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with your choice of toppings. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
