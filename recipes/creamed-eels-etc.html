    <h2>"Oh, there’s so little left. Creamed Eels? Corn Nog? Wadded Beef?"</h2>

    <p>It's slim pickings at the Kwik-E-Mart, so try not to be confused as the last ripe pineapple!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>One eel, skinned and deboned (do you find something funny about the word deboned?)</li>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine onion and butter and cook over medium heat until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chopped eel and mix well. Add in milk and cream.</li>
        <li>Stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a gentle boil and thickens, about 5-10 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper. Allow to cool before eating. Or throw it away, your call.</li>
    </ol>
